MemeShare App is a platform that allows users to discover and share memes. Provide functionality to share memes with your friends in all Social Media Platforms.

In this android application, I call the API by Volley library , do image processing, add multiple libraries in android and share functionality. I use API that is random meme API by github. Also give internet permission and add JsonObjectRequest. I use Glide libraries and add the following dependencies in gradle, add progress bar and set its visibility and lastly set it into recommended way by move the Queue request code to Mysingleton class. This application uses network connectivity and through API call it shows the random meme image that generated by API and add next button which will show the next random meme and also add the share button which will give url of meme and help to share the meme among friends.
